Basho Matsuo

Here are three examples of the haiku of Basho Matsuo, the first great poet of haiku in the 1600s:

An old silent pond...

A frog jumps into the pond,

splash! Silence again.



Autumn moonlight—

a worm digs silently

into the chestnut.



Lightning flash—

what I thought were faces

are plumes of pampas grass.
